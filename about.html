            Hello! My name is Nikola, and I am currently a student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI), specializing in the <strong>PIT</strong> branch. My passion for technology and programming started early, and I’ve been dedicated to developing my skills through both academic and personal projects.
            <br><br>
            Before joining FINKI, I completed my high school education at <strong>OEMUC St. Naum Ohridski</strong>, where I was proud to be among the top students in my class. This strong foundation has fueled my ambition to excel in the field of software development and IT.
            <br><br>
            On this site, you’ll find three main sections:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Skills</strong> — showcasing the technologies and programming languages I have mastered and continue to learn.
            <br>
            <strong>Works</strong> — featuring my projects and practical experiences, demonstrating my abilities in real-world applications.
            <br>
            <strong>Contact</strong> — a simple way to get in touch with me for collaboration, questions, or professional opportunities.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
